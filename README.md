# Tickets

A theatre booking system built on Sanity.io and SvelteKit, using Stripe for payments. Supports box-office bookings, discount codes, reports, and ticket scanning during the event.

Initially developed for the Chicago production by Arthaus, and still under construction. Some bits might still be specific/hard-coded to this performance.
