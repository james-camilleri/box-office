# Tickets

A theatre booking system built on Sanity.io and SvelteKit, using Stripe for payments. Supports box-office bookings, discount codes, reports, and ticket scanning during the event.

This is a monorepo containing two packages â€“ an npm init utility for creating new box office projects, and the theatre booking system itself.
